# Paper Outline

### Abstract
My hometown Suzhou is a major city in the southeastern part of Jiangsu Province in eastern China. It has over 2,500 years of history, with an abundant display of relics and sites of historical interest. It is famous for Suzhou embroidery, Kunqu (one of the oldest extant forms of Chinese opera), Pingtan (a musical/oral performance art form), and Classical Gardens of Suzhou. Since there is an immigrant problem, the Suzhou registered population and the migrant population is half-to-half, which causes the loss of the awareness of passing on the history and culture of Suzhou. I expect children from Suzhou can find some connections between my project and the history and culture of Suzhou. The goal of this project is to make local children interested in Suzhou and try to raise the awareness of them to protect and inherit the history and culture of Suzhou.
