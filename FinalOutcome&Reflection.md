This is an interactive installation shows the concept and the artistic characteristics of the window design in the Classical Gardens of Suzhou. It allows the children living in Suzhou to play with different window frames and see the different scenery through those windows to find the connections between the patterns of the windows and the meanings behind them.

### Reflection

a. What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?

 - My general question in Major Studio 1 class is how to educate children living in Suzhou and make them interested in one of the aspects of Suzhou, and I focus on how to educate local children about the Classical Gardens of Suzhou to make them gain interests in specifically.

b. What the five strengths of your project?

 - Portable.
 - Accessible.
 - Educational.
 - Aesthetical.
 - Playful.

c. What are the five most critical issues for your project?

 - The loss of the history and culture of Suzhou.
 - The historical and cultural background of the Classical Gardens of Suzhou.
 - Educate children living in Suzhou.
 - Window design and borrowed scenery technique in the Classical Gardens of Suzhou.
 - Meanings of the patterns of the windows in the Classical Gardens of Suzhou.

d. What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?

 - Do more research on the history and culture of Suzhou.
 - Interview children living in Suzhou and find out the things they are interested in right now.
 - Try to combine the boring history and culture of Suzhou with the things that kids have interests in.
 - Keep aesthetical characteristics of Suzhou in the project.

e. What new questions do you have?

 - How to make sure that the children living in Suzhou truly get the concept of my project and raise up the awareness of them to encourage local children to protect and inherit the history and culture of Suzhou?

f. What questions need to be answered in order to create a proof of concept prototype?

 - Could the users get the concept of my project?
 - Could they find out the relationships between my project and thing in Suzhou?
 - Is my project conveying the proper feelings to the audiences?
 - Is my project kind of educational for children living in Suzhou?
 - Will the local children want to learn more about the history and culture of Suzhou consciously after experiencing my project?

g. How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel like a possible future direction?

 - I think this project is the starting point for the topic of how to educate children living in Suzhou and make them interested in one of the aspects of Suzhou. There are diversified aspects of Suzhou for me to do research on and create projects with. I will continue focusing on this issue in the future and I hope I can develop more projects related to the history and culture of Suzhou to make local children gain interest in it. Then I can encourage the children living in Suzhou to protect and inherit the history and culture of Suzhou consciously.
