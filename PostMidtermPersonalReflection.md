# Post Midterm Personal Reflection

I’d like to provide a little bit more context based on my presentation since Anna mentioned about thinking about the reason for the disappearance of Suzhou dialect in the critique. I mentioned there is an immigrant problem that caused the loss of Suzhou dialect in the presentation, and the data I found proved this problem. “With a resident population of 10.61 million, Suzhou is the only city in Jiangsu with a permanent population of over 10 million. By the end of 2015, the registered population of Suzhou was 6.67 million, that is, nearly 4 million people were migrants.” (April 28, 2016) Also, Suzhou has a non-resident population of one or two million people. This means that the Suzhou registered population and the migrant population (including non-residents) are originally half-to-half. What’s more, the Suzhou registered population does not mean those people living in Suzhou, the Suzhou registered population also includes millions of people who have settled in Suzhou but from other places. The children of those people definitely don’t speak Suzhou dialect — because they don’t speak Suzhou dialect at home at all.
