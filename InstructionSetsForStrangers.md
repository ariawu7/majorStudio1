### AEIOU Design Method

Since most of the people were just walking through the square, we decided to focus on those poeple who used the cloud shape benches in the World Trade Center.

### Concept Sketch

The cloud is made of cotton and it has a speaker, lights, and sensors inside. If nobody sits on the cloud, it will be the same white color as the other cloud shape benches in the center. However, if there's anyone sits on it, it will produce sound and turn into yellow. If there's another person sit on it, the cloud will be divided into 2 parts with different colors of light. With the numbers of people sit on the cloud increase, the cloud will be colorful and produce more sound. Since this cloud is playful with multiplayer, we'd like to encourage people to invite not only their friends but also strangers to sit on this cloud with them to create a unique cloud with colors. It is a good chance for people to talk with strangers and take photos to record this moment.
