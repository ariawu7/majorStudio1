## Research Question

### How to make children understand the importance of Culture in Suzhou?(encourage children to learn and practice speaking Suzhou dialect, make the Classical Gardens of Suzhou more attractive...)

My hometown Suzhou is a major city in the southeastern part of Jiangsu Province in eastern China. It is famous for Suzhou embroidery, Kunqu (one of the oldest extant forms of Chinese opera), Pingtan (a musical/oral performance art form), and Classical Gardens of Suzhou.

### Protect & Inherit

Suzhou has a history of 2,500 years. As a Suzhounese, I have a responsibility to pass on the long history of Suzhou.
